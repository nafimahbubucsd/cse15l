# Part 2 Reflection
One of the best parts of my time in the lab was when we learned about server.java and localhost. I didn't really know how to use Java code back then, so I asked the teaching assistants for a lot of help. But when I found out that I could change the URL and localhost server with Java code using VSCode, it felt awesome. That's when I started to enjoy coding and computer science even more. I was excited to learn new stuff like making an autograder, writing a bash script, learning about vim, and all that. This class and its lab were more useful than any other class I've taken before. I'm really thankful for all the helpful stuff we were taught.
